# Functions Interview Prep

## Problem 1: Swapping Variables

Write a program that will swap the values of two variables. That is, if we start with:

```js
x == "a"; // => true
y == "b"; // => true
```

Once the program has finished running we will have:

```js
x == "b"; // => true
y == "a"; // => true
```

**Note:** Think about why we cant just do something like `x=y` followed by `y=x`. What goes wrong when we try to do this?

## Problem 2: Reverse a String

Write a function called `reverse` that takes in a string and returns the reverse of the string. For example:

```js
reverse("Hello"); // => returns "olleH"
```

**Note:** You cannot use any built-in array or string methods!
