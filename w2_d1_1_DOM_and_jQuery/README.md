| Use the JS library "jQuery" to select and manipulate DOM elements. |

#BUT FIRST!

Read this [Comparison of jQuery and Vanilla JS](http://bl.ocks.org/joyrexus/5322252) (5 min)

### Motivation (Why?)

jQuery is a very, very popular client-side library. It greatly simplifies:
  * Interacting with the DOM (selecting, changing)
  * Submitting forms
  * Receiving and sending data to APIs (AJAX)

### Analogy (What?)

Shortcut

Libraries & Modules

Standing on the shoulders of giants

Levels of abstraction. Letters, Syllables, Words, Phrases, Sentences, Paragraphs, Books

# Challenges

### Docs & Resources
