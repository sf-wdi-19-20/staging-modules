### Motivation (Why?)

jQuery is a very, very popular client-side library. It greatly simplifies:
  * Interacting with the DOM (selecting, changing)
  * Submitting forms
  * Receiving and sending data to APIs (AJAX)

### Analogy (What?)

External libraries or modules like jQuery are like:

* Shortcuts
* Standing on the shoulders of giants
* Letters, Syllables, Words, Phrases, Sentences, Paragraphs, Books
