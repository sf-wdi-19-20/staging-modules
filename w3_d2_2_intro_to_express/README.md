### Motivation (Why?)

0. Cutting edge web architecture - Client-side architecture with a JSON API server.
1. DRY code
2. Segregation of Duties/Separation of Concerns

### Terminology

1. **NodeJS** is javascript server.
2. **Package Manager** manages installing libraries with their dependencies
3. **NPM** - Node Package Manager
4. **MVC** - Model View Controller convention for web server separation of concerns.
5. **express** - An "unopinionated" MVC framework for node.

### Analogy (What?)

A web server is like a restaurant. The views are the menu. The controllers are the waiter. The model is the cook. The database is the refrigerator.

1. The user looks at the menu and makes a selection
2. The controller tells the cook
3. The cook gets what she needs from the refrigerator, makes the dish and sends it back with the waiter to the user.
