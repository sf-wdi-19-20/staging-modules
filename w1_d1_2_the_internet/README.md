##Challenges

#### Basic Challenges
  1. Go to your favorite website.
  2. Right click in the browser, click `Save As`, then save to your desktop. (If you don't see a `Save As` option, try right clicking a different part of the page or another site. Some sites override the default right click behavior.)
  3. On your desktop, you should have a newly saved folder and HTML file. Open both - what do you notice?
  4. Back in the browser, hit `command + option + i`
  5. You are now in the Elements tab of the Chrome Developer Tools. Click through the other tabs and explore!
  6. Back in the Elements tab, make some CSS changes using the Inspect Elements tool. Take a screenshot so you can show your work to a friend!

#### Stretch Challenges
  1. Go to the Console tab of the Chrome Developer Tools.
  2. Type `4 + 4` in the console, and hit `enter`.
  3. Now, type `hello world` - what does that return?
  4. Try it again, but this time with quotes, `"hello world"`. Much better!

## Tonight's Homework
  1. Make sure you have a GitHub account and have successfully pushed your fundamentals project.
  2. Make sure you have the `subl` command set up so you can open Sublime from your Terminal

    * For **Sublime Text 2**, type this in your terminal:

    ```
    ln -s "/Applications/Sublime Text 2.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl" /usr/local/bin/subl
    ```

    * For **Sublime Text 3**, type this in your terminal:

    ```
    ln -s "/Applications/Sublime Text 3.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl" /usr/local/bin/subl
    ```

    * If you're having problems getting `subl` set up, try reading [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16199581/opening-sublime-text-on-command-line-as-subl-on-mac-os) or [this](http://ashleynolan.co.uk/blog/launching-sublime-from-the-terminal).

  3. Read at least one article from **The Internet** section in the further readings listed below.
  4. Create a directory (folder) somewhere on your computer called `wdi-day-1`.
  5. Inside that directory, create an `index.html` file, and write three interesting things you learned or questions you have from the reading you chose in part 3.
  6. Create a new repo on GitHub called `wdi-day-1`, and push your `index.html` file to that remote repo.
  7. Submit the link to your GitHub repo [here](https://docs.google.com/a/generalassemb.ly/forms/d/14rNXnDaq5X5Rvda-1BRZCl9YmkOoZzf7oxGBEZG_YJE/viewform).
