#Shopping List App

##Minimum Requirements

For a shopping list app, we'd like the user to be able to at least:
* add items to the list
* see the items that are currently on their list
* check off items from their list

What does your user need to remember about each item on their list?
* the item name

A cool additional feature would be to let the user remember how many of each item they need. It'd also be nice to let the user edit the shopping list items, in case, for instance, they decide to change the item name to specify their favorite brand.
