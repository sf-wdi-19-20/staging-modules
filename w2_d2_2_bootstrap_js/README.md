#Challenges

### Docs & Resources

[Bootstrap JavaScript Docs](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/)

### Basic Challenges

1. Create a new project called `bootstrap-js` and create a project with bootstrap.
2. Add a navbar, a jumbotron with a container containing a header 1 welcome message, and below that another container
2. Add the bootstrap tabs component below the jumbotron
4. In one of the tabs, like an article in a news site, at some text to a box, and a link called 'more' that uncollapses and collapses some lorem ipsum text in it.
3. Above your tabs but below the jumbotron, put a link called 'login' that reveals a login modal (email, password, login button) (can you make it a narrow modal?)

### Stretch Challenges

1. Extending challenge 4 above, can you get the 'more' link to say 'less' when it is uncollapsed?
2. Add a scrollspy navbar to your `bootstrap-js` project
3. Put your contact me form in a modal in your portfolio project
