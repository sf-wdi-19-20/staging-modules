#To Do Lab

Objective: Build a to do app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with jQuery.

##Minimum Requirements

The user will be able to:    
	* add tasks to their to do list     
	* see the tasks that are currently on their list 
	* cross off tasks by clicking them

Each task will include:    
	* a task title    
	* a description of the task    

##Bonus

Goal: Due Dates    
1. Give each task a due date. Consider using the JavaScript [Date](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date) data structure.
1. Change the styling of a task if its due date is soon.

Goal: Delete/Remove Tasks   
1. Instead of crossing off tasks when clicked, remove the task from the view and the model.
1. Building off part 1, add a delete button to each task. Update your code so that the task is only deleted when the button is clicked.

Goal: Edit Tasks
1. Create a form to edit tasks. Add the form to each task.
1. Add an edit button to each task display, and style the form so that it *toggles* when the edit button is clicked.
1. Use the form data to change the task in the view and the model.

Goal: Styling / Branding
1. Add nicer styling to your page to make it more attractive to users.
