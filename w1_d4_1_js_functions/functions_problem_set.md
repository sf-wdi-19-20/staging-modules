# Functions - Problem Set

These problems require you to build functions using your knowledge of looping and conditionals.

## merge(arr1, arr2)

Write a function that takes two sorted arrays of numbers and returns a merged array of the sorted numbers. For example, if the input arrays were `var arr1 = [3,6,11]` and `var arr2 = [2,4,5,8,9]`, the returned array would be: `[2,3,4,5,6,8,9,11]`.

## letterCount(word)

Write a function that counts the number of times each letter occurs in a given string. It should return an object containing the count for each letter. For example, the string "apple" would return the following:

```js
{
  a: 1,
  p: 2,
  l: 1,
  e: 1
}
```

**Bonus**: Make sure that lower case letters and upper case letters count for the same character. Also, ignore spaces and punctuation.

## sillySum(arr)

Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns the sum of each number multiplied by its index.

```js
count += (number * index)
```

## numSquare(max)

Create a function called `numSquare` that will return an array of all perfect square numbers up to, but not exceeding a max number.

## isPrime(num)

Create a function that returns `true` if the number passed in is a prime number and `false` if not.

## primes(max)

Using your `isPrime` function, create a function `primes` that will return an array of all prime numbers up to, but not exceeding a max number.
